# Morrowind75
A starter Morrowind modlist including Tamriel Rebuilt to build upon.

# Introduction
This is a modlist based on very simple rules:
- Only 75 mods
- Maximum quality of life and performance
- No visual overhaul
- No mods with dependencies where possible

All the starting setup (MGE XE, MWSE, Morrowind Code Patch) is already done.

What it includes:
- Basic core mods: Tamriel Data, OAAB Data, and Addendum to Tamrielic Lore Data
- Addons: Graphic herbalism, Patch for Purists, UI Expansion
- Latest MGE XE developer release with shared memory (no more out of memory issues!)
- A ton of quality of life mods

# Requirements
A potato PC should run it with no issues

# Installation
Standard Wabbajack installation.

# Important mods you should know about
I have included a lot of Merlord's stuff:
- Ashfall (Use alt+click to open backpacks without unequipping them. You can change this in Ashfall MCM if you prefer another combination)
- Joy of Painting
- DRIP
- Bardic Inspiration
- Ultimate Fishing

Character leveling is done in the background by MULE. If you prefer vanilla minmaxing, you can disable MULE.

Chargen Scenarios allows you to choose non-vanilla starts. If you prefer the vanilla one, you can disable this mod.

Sophisticated Save system is configured to auto-save every 10 minutes. You can change this in the MCM

Magicka of the Third Era is a "balancing" mod for magic which I think is cool. I have included a custom version which allows you to have a vanilla-ish experience with cast chances. Feel free to configure in the MCM if you prefer otherwise.

# If you want a "purist" vanilla experience
Disable everything under the Immersion and Cool Stuff, Alternate Starts, and Magic separators in MO2. Run TES3Merge from the MO2 executable dropdown, and you are ready to go.

# Other stuff
This is my first Wabbajack modlist. I have done everything as best as I could, but feel free to contact me if you find a bug or something to be corrected. Thanks for your help!

# Have Fun!
