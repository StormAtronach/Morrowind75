# Morrowind75
A starter Morrowind modlist including Tamriel Rebuilt to build upon.

# Introduction
This is a modlist based on very simple rules:
- Only 75 mods
- Maximum quality of life and performance
- No visual overhaul
- No mods that will require a ton of patches

All the starting setup (MGE XE, MWSE, Morrowind Code Patch) is already done.

What it includes:
- Basic core mods: Tamriel Data, OAAB Data, and Addendum to Tamrielic Lore Data
- Addons: Graphic herbalism, Patch for Purists, UI Expansion
- Immersion: Ashfall, Joy of Painting, Ulimate Fishing, and more!
- Latest MGE XE developer release with shared memory (no more out of memory issues!)
- A ton of quality of life mods

# Requirements
A potato PC should run it with no issues

If you are still facing performance issues, you can:
- Disable antialiasing.
- Disable dynamic solar shadows and per-pixel lighting shader in MGE XE.
- If this is still not enough, disable all reflections.
- And if that is still not enough, disable distant land entirely.

# Installation
Standard Wabbajack installation. On a first start, you may want to open MGE XE from the MO2 dropdown to adjust your personal preferences such as resolution.

The root folder contains the executables, including the MWSEUpdate.exe. It is a good idea to run it regularly to keep MWSE updated to its latest version.

# Important mods you should know about
I have included a lot of Merlord's stuff:
- Ashfall (Use alt+click to open backpacks without unequipping them. You can change this in Ashfall MCM if you prefer another combination)
- Joy of Painting
- DRIP
- Bardic Inspiration
- Ultimate Fishing

Character leveling is done in the background by MULE. If you prefer vanilla minmaxing, you can disable MULE.

Chargen Scenarios allows you to choose non-vanilla starts. If you prefer the vanilla one starting with Jiub in the boat, you can disable this mod.

Sophisticated Save system is configured to auto-save every 10 minutes. You can change this in the MCM

Magicka of the Third Era is a "balancing" mod for magic which I think is cool. I have included a custom version which allows you to have a vanilla-ish experience with ajusted cast chances. In the MCM, choose the "Hybrid" option in the dropdown menu.

# If you want a "purist" vanilla experience
Disable everything under the Immersion and Cool Stuff, Alternate Starts, and Magic separators in MO2. Run TES3Merge from the MO2 executable dropdown, and you are ready to go.

# Other stuff
When you first start the game with Wares enabled, there will be three errors. Just click "ok", they are harmless. These should go away in a future version of Wares.

This is my first Wabbajack modlist. I have done everything as best as I could, but feel free to contact me if you find a bug or something to be corrected. Thanks for your help!

# Have Fun!
